# Tip Amount Prediction for New York Yellow Taxi

This is a piece work from MAST30034 Applied Data Science Project 2(University of Melborune).

I finished this work in 10/2021 with Python programming.

In this Project, tip amount prediction is achieved by considering several causes (e.g. fare amount, extra fee).

The data is freely available to download from https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.

code.ipynb is the code file, plots folder gives all graphs generated by the program.
